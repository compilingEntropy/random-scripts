Random bash scripts
===================

This is without warranty, no support, use-at-your-own-risk type software. It is provided because it may prove helpful to someone someday. Filing issues is encouraged, but feature requests could be ignored as this software is not intended to hold your hand or be particularly user friendly.

I will update this document with some overview information for each script including stability and completeness. For more information, you will be able to check out each directory's individual readme.
